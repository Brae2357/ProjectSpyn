# Project Spyn - BasicallyWaymo
This project was completed for the Fall 2024 session of FSE 100 at Arizona State University. The object was to design and program an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a maze using real-time environmental sensing, built with the LEGO EV3 kit.

Our team developed BasicallyWaymo, an autonomous robot inspired by Waymo's self-driving car. The vehicle was equipped with an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a rotating motor, enabling it to perform 360-degree scans of its surroundings. This allowed the vehicle to detect walls, map the maze, and make informed navigation decisions.

## Key features of BasicallyWaymo included:
- A 360-degree rotating ultrasonic sensor for environmental awareness.
- Autonomous maze-solving using sensor data and decision-making algorithms.
- The ability to make stops at specific checkpoints, simulating traffic stops or pick-up locations.
- Manual control mode to pick up passenger.
- Dynamic map construction and pathfinding to traverse unknown environments.

## Team Credits
BasicallyWaymo was developed by Braeden West, Samantha Gately, Manasi Tripathi, and Abdu Mohamed as part of the FSE 100 course at ASU.
